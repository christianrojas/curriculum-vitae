#### **IQVIA**

> Senior Software Engineer - Technical Lead
> (_Feb 2022 - Oct 2022 · 9 mos_) Contract

As a `Senior Software Engineer`, I spend 50% on coding and as a reviewer in every pull request in the codebase; the other 50%, I check and review new features.

As a `Technical leader`, I help with assignations(using `Jira`), feature prioritization, scope valuations, and help developers if they have any stoppers in their assignations.

Responsibilities:

- Create a new `ReactJS` application and setup the structure.
- Migrate an EmberJS App to `ReactJS`.
- Set up `Kubernetes` and `Docker`.
- Set up `Jenkins` CI scripts for the new `ReactJS` project.
- Migrate the EmberJS application to `ReactJS` and improve all required `Ruby on Rails` backend endpoints.
- Create a knowledge base in confluence for the ReactJS components, structure, and Ruby on Rails backend endpoints.

We created solutions that help users with almost zero technical skills interact with the `cryptocurrency` ecosystem.

As a `Senior Software Engineer`, I spend 50% on coding and as a reviewer in every pull request in the codebase.

For the other 50%, I follow the progress in the current cycle and shape and write pitches for new features.

As a `Technical leader`, I help with the team assignment for new features in the betting table(using `Basecamp`), and I help my team if they have any stoppers.

As a `Senior Consultant`, I did the knowledge transfer and helped them evaluate the Roadmap.

I have experience with some top `Agile Methodologies` like `Scrum`, `Kanban`, `Scrumban`, and `ShapeUp`.

Responsibilities:

- I worked on `Ruby on Rails` development, `data modeling`, `architecture` implementations, `testing`.
- I worked on the code style rules across codebases using `Rubocop`, `Brakeman`, and `Solargraph`.
- I worked on `Bug tracking` and log system using `Sentry`, and `Datadog`.

- I worked on `Sidekiq` with workers for `background jobs`.
- I worked on `RabbitMQ` `queues` to communicate within applications.
- I worked on the `VueJS` migration to `StimulusJS`.
- I Implemented `StimulusReflex` and `HotWire` to improve the development velocity.
- I worked with `GitHub Actions` to set up our `Continuous integration` system and the `Heroku Pipelines` for `Continuous Deployment`.
- I worked on connecting our `monolithic` `Rails` app with the `Blockchain as a service platform` called `BitGo` using `Blockchain` and the `Internet of money` best practices.
- I worked on the implementation of `Bitcoin`, `Ethereum`, `Dash`, `Litecoin`, and some `stable-coins` like `Tether`, `Dai`, and `USDC` in the product.
- I worked on transactional notifications using `Email`, `SMS`, `Slack`, and the `Telegram`.
- I worked on the `State machines` for different `data modeling` and interactions within data.
- I migrated every `UI` interface from `BootstrapCSS` to `TailwindCSS`.
- I worked on new `patterns` and `best practices` on `data structure`, `classes`, `models`, `services`, `Decorators`, `Presenters`, `Libs`, and `Web components` using the `Github` library.
- I worked on tracking changes in models for `auditing` or `versioning`.
- I worked on the internal `ledger` that concentrates every single platform transaction using `Active Record Transactions` to prevent issues in the users' balances.
- I worked on the implementation of `AWS` `S3`, `IAM`, `Route53`, and some `EC2` instances.
