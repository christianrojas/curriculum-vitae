## 👋 Hi, I'm Christian Rojas
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-rojas-garnica/) | [Github](https://github.com/christianrojas) | [Twitter \(X\)](https://twitter.com/christianrojas)

I'm a **software engineer** whose passion for coding ignited in 2008. I firmly believe that **dedication** and **clarity** in coding are not just professional traits but the **foundation** for crafting elegant and game-changing solutions that impact **how we live and work**.

I’m passionate about DDD(Domain Driven Design), OOD(Object Oriented Design), nuances of language and idioms, and how we communicate.

> You can really get to know a Software Engineer by how they name things in their code.
